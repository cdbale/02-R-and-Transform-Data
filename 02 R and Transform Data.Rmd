##  Let's Get Set Up With R/RStudio

<center>
![](../../Figures/r_rstudio.png){width=900px}
</center>

## R/RStudio Orientation

- Console: Where you run code and perform calculations.

```{r}
#| eval: false
5 + 5
```

- Source: Create and **save** R scripts and send code to the Console.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Use comments to explain (the why of) your code.
print(2 * (18 - 7))
```

- Environment: A snapshot of what you have loaded.
- Help: Look up documentation including cheatsheets.
- Files: The **working directory** for your project.

## RStudio Tools > Global Options

- General > Save workspace to .RData on exit: Never.
- Code > Editing > Execution > Ctrl + Enter executes: Multiple consecutive R lines.
- Code > Editing > Use native pipe operator.
- Code > Display > General > Highlight selected line.
- Code > Display > General > Rainbow parentheses.
- Code > Saving > Automatically save when editor loses focus.
- Appearance.

## Functions

<center>
![](../../Figures/functions.png){width=650px}
</center>

We import, wrangle, visualize, and model data using **functions**. Functions are composed of **arguments** that tell the function how to operate.

- Using a function is referred to as a “call” or a “function call.”
- Don’t forget you have Help.

## The tidyverse

The **tidyverse** is a collection of R packages that share common philosophies and are designed to work together. An **R package** is a collection of functions, documentation, and sometimes data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Import CSV Files

```{r eval=FALSE}
customer_data <- read_csv("customer_data.csv")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
customer_data <- read_csv(here::here("Data", "customer_data.csv"))
```

---

- Note that `customer_data` now appears in our Environment.
- The Environment lists any **objects** (i.e., data or custom functions) we've assigned a name using `<-`.
- We can also view objects in their own tab.

## Data Frames

```{r}
customer_data
```

---

```{r}
glimpse(customer_data)
```

## Transform Data

The heart of data wrangling is **transforming data**.

- Filter observations.
- Arrange observations.
- Slice observations.
- Select variables.
- Mutate variables (i.e., recode or create new variables).
- Join data frames.

{dplyr} provides a consistent **grammar for transforming data** with functions (a.k.a., **verbs**) that mirror SQL.

## Filter Observations

We often want to filter our data to **keep certain observations using column values**.

```{r}
filter(customer_data, college_degree == "Yes")
```

---

```{r}
filter(customer_data, region != "West")
```

---

How would we filter by `gender == "Female"` and `income > 70000`?

Why are we putting quotes around `"Female"` but not `gender`?

---

```{r}
filter(customer_data, gender == "Female", income > 70000)
```

## Slice Observations

Sometimes we want to slice our data to **keep certain observations using their position in the data**.

```{r}
slice(customer_data, 1:5)
```

## Arrange Observations

We can arrange observations to reveal helpful information and check data.

```{r}
arrange(customer_data, birth_year)
```

---

```{r}
arrange(customer_data, desc(birth_year))
```

## Select Variables

Sometimes we only care to **keep certain variables**, especially when working with a large dataset.

```{r}
select(customer_data, region:review_text)
```

---

<center>
![](../../Figures/monsters_mutate.png){width=600px}
</center>

## Mutate Variables

We can also **recode existing variables** or **create new variables**.

```{r}
mutate(customer_data, income = income / 1000)
```

---

Two important things to remember:

1. We can **overwrite** variables in a data frame as well as objects if we use the same name.
2. Good variable and object names only use lowercase letters, numbers, and `_`. For example: `good_name2` and `2bad name`. Bad names should be renamed (but can be referenced if surrounded with `" "`).

## Join Data Frames

A common variable (e.g., an ID) allows us to **join** two data frames.

```{r eval=FALSE}
store_transactions <- read_csv("store_transactions.csv")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
store_transactions <- read_csv(here::here("Data", "store_transactions.csv"))
```

---

```{r}
glimpse(store_transactions)
```

---

A **left join** keeps all rows in the "left" data frame plus all columns from both data frames. A left join is a good "default" join to start with.

```{r}
left_join(customer_data, store_transactions, join_by(customer_id))
```

---

<center>
![](../../Figures/left_join.gif){width=500px}
</center>

---

An **inner join** keeps rows that have matching IDs along with all columns from both data frames.

```{r}
inner_join(customer_data, store_transactions, join_by(customer_id))
```

---

<center>
![](../../Figures/inner_join.gif){width=500px}
</center>

## Consecutive Function Calls

We typically want to perform many consecutive function calls. You might be tempted to do the following. **Don't do this!**

```{r}
crm_data_2 <- left_join(customer_data, store_transactions, join_by(customer_id))
crm_data_3 <- filter(crm_data_2, region == "West", feb_2005 == max(feb_2005))
crm_data_4 <- mutate(crm_data_3, age = 2022 - birth_year)
crm_data_5 <- select(crm_data_4, age, feb_2005)
crm_data_6 <- arrange(crm_data_5, desc(age))
crm_data_7 <- slice(crm_data_6, 1)

crm_data_7
```


---

This would be another way run the same code. **Don't do this either!**

```{r}
slice(
  arrange(
    select(
      mutate(
        filter(
          left_join(
            customer_data, store_transactions, join_by(customer_id)), 
          region == "West", feb_2005 == max(feb_2005)
        ), 
      age = 2022 - birth_year), 
    age, feb_2005), 
  desc(age)), 
1)
```

## Consecutive Lines of Code

Part of the common philosophy for the tidyverse is that:

- Each function should do one specific thing well.
- Each function should have a data frame as an input and a data frame as an output.

This allows us to `|>` together functions in **consecutive lines of code** so that it is easier for humans to read and less error-prone.

---

```{r}
filter(customer_data, credit == 850, state == "WY")
```

```{r}
customer_data |> 
  filter(.data = _, credit == 850, state == "WY")
```

---

- So what does the `|>` do?
- What's the deal with the indented line after the `|>`?
- Let's rewrite our terrible code using the `|>`.

---

Read `|>` as *then*. (If we need to use `<-`, we typically put it at the beginning.)

```{r}
customer_data |> 
  left_join(store_transactions, join_by(customer_id)) |> 
  filter(region == "West", feb_2005 == max(feb_2005)) |> 
  mutate(age = 2023 - birth_year) |> 
  select(age, feb_2005) |> 
  arrange(desc(age)) |> 
  slice(1)
```

## Exercise 2

In RStudio on Posit Cloud, create a new R script, load the tidyverse, and import the data. Then, using the `|>` in consecutive lines of code, find the customers who have spent the most recently by doing the following.

1. Join the `customer_data` and `store_transactions` data.
2. Only keep customers in the `South`.
3. Create a new variable `age` using `2023 - birth_year`.
4. Only keep the variables `age`, `gender`, `income`, `credit`, `married`, `college_degree`, `region`, and `dec_2018`.
5. Arrange the data in descending order based on `dec_2018` transactions.
6. Keep the top 3 rows of data.
7. Who appears to be purchasing the most items for this month in the South?
8. Export the R script and upload to Canvas.
